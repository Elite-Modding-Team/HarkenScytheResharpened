### Getting Started

#### Soul Path

![Harken Scythe Scythes](./docs/scythes.png)

- To get started with reaping soul essence, you first need to construct a Scythe.
- Scythes can be made with any vanilla material like iron, as well as certain materials from other mods if supported.
- To reap soul essence from an entity, you need to use the Scythe's special ability by _right-clicking_ and letting go, whilst targeting a creature. If the creature is killed during this process, it may drop its soul, depending on the tool material quality of the Scythe.
- To store your freshly reaped essence on the go, you need to construct an essence keeper. It can be upgraded to an essence vessel if more capacity is desired. Experienced reapers keep several for both essence types!
- To bottle reaped essence, you need to target and _right-click_ them with either essence keepers or essence vessels.
- To get started with conducting rituals, you first need to construct an Altar of Souls to arrange items for magical infusion.
- If an altar and crucibles of the same type are placed next to each other (default is a radius of 4 blocks) and the crucibles are filled with essence, enchanting rituals can take place.
- Each enchantable item possesses an essence cost for a successful magical transformation. If enough essence is available for this process, _right-click_ on the altar with a Harken Athame to perform the ritual.
- You can optionally also use [**JEI**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei)/[**HEI**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/had-enough-items) to see altar recipes and essence costs.

- To get started with reaping blood essence, you first need to construct a Glaive.
- Glaives can be made with any vanilla material like iron, as well as certain materials from other mods if supported.
- To reap blood essence from an entity, you need to use the Glaive's special ability by _right-clicking_ and letting go, whilst targeting a creature. If the creature is hurt during this process, it may drop its blood, depending on the tool material quality of the Glaive.
